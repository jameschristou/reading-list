## Podcasts

| [Masters of Scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) | Reid Hoffman | This is my favourite podcast. Reid (founder of LinkedIn) is an incredible story teller and he never fails to teach you something as he interviews the most successful people in the Tech industry. There are some incredible stories of how the most successful Silicon Valley icons started and currently there is a special **Rapid Response** set of episodes that focus specifically on the social and COVID related challenges facing American industry. | Tech, Entrepreneurship, Start Ups, Leadership | :star::star::star::star::star: |
