## Previously Read
| Title     | Author | Description | Categories | My Rating |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| [Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams](https://www.amazon.com.au/Product-Leadership-Richard-Banfield/dp/1491960604) | Richard Banfield | I think this book would be a must read for aspiring product leaders. It focuses on the approaches and techniques used by successful product leaders with lots of interviews and real life examples. As an engineer I found it useful and interesting to see what challenges product leaders come across and many of the lessons that make successful product leaders can also be applied to leadership in engineering. | Leadership, Product Management, Product Leadership | 4/5 |
|[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585) | Steven Levy | I'm a self confessed Google fan boy so I loved reading this book. It's basically the history of Google (up until 2010) as told through interviews with many of the people that helped build it. There's some great insights into the collegiate, engineering culture that Larry Page and Sergey Brin created and how this was scaled to create one of the most successful and influential businesses of our time. The book details the many challenges they faced as Google grew but also highlights how often they made the right calls. | Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Tech, Culture | 4/5 |
|[The Manager`s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897)  | Camille Fournier  | This is a must read book for anyone interested in becoming a Software Engineering leader. The author takes you through the journey of career growth, from Software Engineer all the way up to CTO, and this is based on their own experience. There are lots of great practical tips and advice for anyone at any step of this journey. I'm a Development Team Lead but I found the whole book applicable and valuable. | Leadership, Management, Engineering | 5/5 |
|[The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Joy-Lasting-Happiness-Changing/dp/0399185046)|Douglas Carlton Abrams|This book has helped me reflect on my own happiness and what brings true joy to my life. The author follows the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu as they discuss the challenges of leading a life of joy. It's spiritual and profound and has helped me bring a better me to work, but more importantly, into my personal relationships.|Self Improvement| 5/5 |
|[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com.au/RADICAL-CANDOR-KIM-SCOTT/dp/1250103509)|Kim Scott|My favourite book on giving and receiving feedback. This has been one of the most influencial reads on my career as a manager and leader.|Leadership, Management, Culture | 5/5 |
|[Build It: The Rebel Playbook for World-Class Employee Engagement](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Playbook-World-Class-Employee-Engagement/dp/1119390052)|Glenn Elliott, Debra Corey|Not all the books I read hit the mark and resonate with me. This is one that unfortunately missed the mark and is probably targetted more at a HR audience.|Leadership, Culture | 2/5 |
|[Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs](https://www.amazon.com.au/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221)|John Doerr|This is a must read book for anyone interested in learning more about OKRs and the benefits they can bring to an organisation. There's some really great case stories of their use at Google.|OKRs| 5/5 |
|[Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose](https://www.amazon.com.au/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220)|Tony Hsieh|The story of the culture at Zappos and what has made them so successful and popular with their customers.|Culture, Entrepreneurship|4/5|
|[The Lonely Planet Story: Once While Travelling](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Story-While-Travelling-ebook/dp/B0090NYECI)|Tony Wheeler, Maureen Wheeler|This is a great story about following your passion to build a successful business and brand from the ground up and all the challenges along the way.|Entrepreneurship|5/5|
|[The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/)|Robert C. Martin|Another Uncle Bob classic. I don't agree with everything in this book but there's still plenty of gold around becoming a more effective developer.|Programming, Software Engineering|4/5|
|[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)|Robert C. Martin|One of the classics from Uncle Bob. It's a little Java centric and perhaps starting to show its age (2009) but still a good read.|Programming, Software Engineering|4/5|
|[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.amazon.com.au/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)|Andrew Hunt, David Thomas|This is the book that has probably had the single biggest influence on the way I approach writing code and it ingrained in me the importance of having a philosophy towards code. It helped me become a better engineer and opened my eyes to the importance of reading to continue to grow and learn. Without this book I definitely would not be the engineer I am today and if I could only have one programming book in my library, this would be it.|Programming, Software Engineering|5/5|
