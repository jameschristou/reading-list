| [13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do: Take Back Your Power, Embrace Change, Face Your Fears, and Train Your Brain for Happiness and Success](https://www.amazon.com.au/Things-Mentally-Strong-People-Dont/dp/0062358308) |Amy Morin| I've been reading a lot of self help books recently and that's because I've gone through a period of challenge in my personal life but also professionally. This is a great book for those who want to become more resilient and practice healthier thinking styles that will help build mental strength. It helps you understand those unhelpful behaviours we all sometimes exhibit, the negative impact that they have on us and the people around us and then gives you tips on how to start thinking differently. | Self-Help | 5/5 |
| [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.amazon.com.au/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) |Daniel H. Pink| This is a great book that helps explain the science of motivation as understood today. It goes in depth on the importance of autonomy, mastery and purpose to motivation and how incentives can actually hurt our instrinsic motivation. I really recommend this book for any leader. | Leadership | 5/5 |
| [The Resilience Project: Finding Happiness through Gratitude, Empathy and Mindfulness](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resilience-Project-Happiness-Gratitude-Mindfulness/dp/1760892777) |Hugh van Cuylenburg| I bought this book at one of the WHSmith stores at Melbourne Airport before a recent flight to Manila, just so I had something to read on the flight in case I wasn't happy with what was on offer with the in flight entertainment. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down and I ended up reading the entire 250 or so pages on the flight. Hugh writes from his own experiences, including watching his sister battle anorexia and his observations of how positive people were while he was teaching young students in underpriviliged communities in northern India. Hugh believes the key to a happier life can be found through practicing gratitude, empathy and mindfulness. It's a really easy book to read and there's lots of tips and lessons that all of us can reflect on. | Self-Help | 5/5 |
| [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com.au/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911/) | John Kotter | Uses the story of a colony of penguins who discover their iceberg is melting as an example to show what good change management and leadership can look like. I read this book after going through some significant changes in some teams I was leading and it really resonated. It's in large font and really easy to read so I was able to finish it within a day. I really recommend it for all leaders (because change is constant) but especially to those going through significant change. | Change Management, Leadership | 5/5 |
| [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.com.au/DevOPS-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/) | Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, John Willis | One of the classics of devops literature and for very good reason. This book does a great job of outlining the benefits of a devops transformation and why technology organisations should adopt devops practices. | DevOps, Software Engineering | 5/5 |
| [Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow](https://www.amazon.com.au/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819/) |Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais | Wow I wish I had read this book about a year ago! It gives you a model for structuring software teams to deliver value continuously and sustainably. It covers Conways Law, touches on the learnings from DevOps and talks about the types of teams and the interactions between them that help make software teams thrive. If you're facing challenges around team structure, and seeing signals like unclear ownership, poor delivery, teams feeling overburdened then this is a must read. It's full of great case studies and practical advice and is fast becoming one of the classics in software engineering literature. | DevOps, Software Engineering, Architecture | 5/5 |
| [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and Devops: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.com.au/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) | Nicole Forsgren Phd, Jez Humble, Gene Kim | Still think you can't move fast without sacrificing quality and breaking things? This is the book you need to read. Full of industry research which debunks this myth and in fact proves that businesses that have embraced DevOps can deliver new customer value faster, with more frequent deployments, lower mean time to restore and a lower change failure percentage. Businesses which embrace this way of operating have a clear competitive advantage. This book is a must read classic for the modern software engineering professional. | DevOps, Software Engineering | 5/5 |
| [Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X) |Melissa Perri| | Product Management, Leadership | 4/5 |
| [Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com.au/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) |Richard Rumelt| I have recently been part of a strategy working group at work and this book was recommended to me. As someone who has never been part of formulating a strategy I found it immensely useful and it helped me understand what a good strategy should look like and the problems a good strategy solves. The language used by the author did at times make it feel like this book was written many decades ago but it is definitely up to date and contains many examples of good and bad strategy from Roman times all the way up to today with companies like Apple. I would recommend this to anyone working on strategy. | Strategy, Leadership | 4/5 |
| [No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860) | Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer | Reed and Erin talk about what they've done at Netflix from a culture and people perspective to make them one of the most successful companies of recent times. Don't read this book thinking you can apply all of their recommendations to your own business or team - policies such as "good performance will get you a generous severance" would probably not make sense for most businesses, but its great reading none the less. | Culture, Leadership | 4/5 |
| [Building Mobile Apps at Scale: 39 Engineering Challenges](https://www.amazon.com.au/Building-Mobile-Apps-Scale-Engineering/dp/1638778868) | Gergely Orosz | George puts forward 39 challenges that mobile development teams are likely to face as they scale, based on his own experience at Uber and drawing upon the experiences of other industry leading apps built for scale. As someone with little mobile app development experience who is currently leading a mobile development team I found this book especially useful and insightful. It's helped give me a better understanding of some of the unique challenges that mobile engineering teams face and some things to think about as we continue to grow and scale. | Software Engineering, Mobile, Scale | 5/5 |
| [Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and Build Successful Teams](https://www.amazon.com.au/Product-Leadership-Richard-Banfield/dp/1491960604) | Richard Banfield | I think this book would be a must read for aspiring product leaders. It focuses on the approaches and techniques used by successful product leaders with lots of interviews and real life examples. As an engineer I found it useful and interesting to see what challenges product leaders come across and many of the lessons that make successful product leaders can also be applied to leadership in engineering. | Leadership, Product Management, Product Leadership | 4/5 |
|[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives](https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585) | Steven Levy | I'm a self confessed Google fan boy so I loved reading this book. It's basically the history of Google (up until 2010) as told through interviews with many of the people that helped build it. There's some great insights into the collegiate, engineering culture that Larry Page and Sergey Brin created and how this was scaled to create one of the most successful and influential businesses of our time. The book details the many challenges they faced as Google grew but also highlights how often they made the right calls. | Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Tech, Culture | 4/5 |
|[The Manager`s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manager%60s-Path-Camille-Fournier/dp/1491973897)  | Camille Fournier  | This is a must read book for anyone interested in becoming a Software Engineering leader. The author takes you through the journey of career growth, from Software Engineer all the way up to CTO, and this is based on their own experience. There are lots of great practical tips and advice for anyone at any step of this journey. I'm a Development Team Lead but I found the whole book applicable and valuable. | Leadership, Management, Engineering | 5/5 |
|[The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Joy-Lasting-Happiness-Changing/dp/0399185046)|Douglas Carlton Abrams|This book has helped me reflect on my own happiness and what brings true joy to my life. The author follows the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu as they discuss the challenges of leading a life of joy. It's spiritual and profound and has helped me bring a better me to work, but more importantly, into my personal relationships.|Self-Help| 5/5 |
|[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com.au/RADICAL-CANDOR-KIM-SCOTT/dp/1250103509)|Kim Scott|My favourite book on giving and receiving feedback. This has been one of the most influencial reads on my career as a manager and leader.|Leadership, Management, Culture | 5/5 |
|[Build It: The Rebel Playbook for World-Class Employee Engagement](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Playbook-World-Class-Employee-Engagement/dp/1119390052)|Glenn Elliott, Debra Corey|Not all the books I read hit the mark and resonate with me. This is one that unfortunately missed the mark and is probably targetted more at a HR audience.|Leadership, Culture | 2/5 |
|[Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs](https://www.amazon.com.au/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221)|John Doerr|This is a must read book for anyone interested in learning more about OKRs and the benefits they can bring to an organisation. There's some really great case stories of their use at Google.|OKRs| 5/5 |
|[Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose](https://www.amazon.com.au/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446576220)|Tony Hsieh|The story of the culture at Zappos and what has made them so successful and popular with their customers.|Culture, Entrepreneurship|4/5|
|[The Lonely Planet Story: Once While Travelling](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Story-While-Travelling-ebook/dp/B0090NYECI)|Tony Wheeler, Maureen Wheeler|This is a great story about following your passion to build a successful business and brand from the ground up and all the challenges along the way.|Entrepreneurship|5/5|
|[The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/)|Robert C. Martin|Another Uncle Bob classic. I don't agree with everything in this book but there's still plenty of gold around becoming a more effective developer.|Programming, Software Engineering|4/5|
|[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)|Robert C. Martin|One of the classics from Uncle Bob. It's a little Java centric and perhaps starting to show its age (2009) but still a good read.|Programming, Software Engineering|4/5|
|[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.amazon.com.au/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)|Andrew Hunt, David Thomas|This is the book that has probably had the single biggest influence on the way I approach writing code and it ingrained in me the importance of having a philosophy towards code. It helped me become a better engineer and opened my eyes to the importance of reading to continue to grow and learn. Without this book I definitely would not be the engineer I am today and if I could only have one programming book in my library, this would be it.|Programming, Software Engineering|5/5|
